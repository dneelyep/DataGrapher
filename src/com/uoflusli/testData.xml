<!--Our largest software need, outside of the previously explained software, is having the ability to analyze the
        data we receive. After the competition in April, we have to submit one final report that explains
        our findings. Naturally, graphs and pictures are great ways at illustrating how our systems performed.
        Take the XML parser that you already made and modify it to work with the existing packet structure shown
        in the attached picture. Assume the XML file is a bunch of these packets stored serially, one after another,-->
<!--encapsulated by <packet>1</packet> tags and that the data fields will be in the same order. Your software should-->
<!--be able to plot all atmospheric data, accelerometer data, and gyroscope data versus time AND latitude & longitude
(two separate graphs). You may generate the graphs using Excel, however, I encourage you to try your hand at Matlab
(free to Speed students, downloadable here after logging into the online store) or Octave (the open source alternative).
(If you choose the Matlab/Octave route, then it opens up the door for us to 3D model the payload and move it in
time according to the kinematic data, i.e. a simulated replay of the payload movement in time. The movie can then
be used to visually relate the payload orientation to the values of the atmospheric data.) If you want to learn
Matlab/Octave, I can teach you everything you'll need to know to accomplish graphing in an hour or two. Beyond
that, we'll have to work together to figure out extra features. -->
